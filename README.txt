This is a simple project to satisfy a need I have. I frequently find myself diff'ing two similar output files that contain lots of numbers, but unfortunately, all the diff program's I've found so far only do textual comparison of the numbers, so 7.4 is as far from 704 as 7.5.

The goal of this project, then, is to create a set of tools (eventually GUI-based), that will allow for the ease of use of modern diff programs, but allow for any number of numerical comparisons on the two sets of numbers.

Note: this project is really old and in need of some rejuvenation.
